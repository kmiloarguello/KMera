# myFullStack

Repository for my own test of my applications and websites and more. There are some branches: one for ReactJS, other for NodeJS, other for Angular, etc.  My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer.

By now I'm working in a web app to upload and share pictures. It's called KMera. The figure below shows KMera's structure.
